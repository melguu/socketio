# socketio

## Namespaces vs rooms
Namespaces are bound to certain endpoints within the application, which helps create separation between different communication channels. Rooms are arbitrary channels within these namespaces

## Sockets in project?
Sockets could come in handy, if I were to implement a real-time chat for a group of songwriters (a band), to aid communication whilst in the process of constructing their song.
